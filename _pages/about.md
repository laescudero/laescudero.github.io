I am a PhD student at the University of Vienna working under the supervision of [José Luis Romero](https://sites.google.com/site/jlromeroresearch/) and [Günther Koliander](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/isf/unser-team/koliander-guenther) from the [Acoustic Research Institute](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/isf) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. 

My research primarily focuses on Time-Frequency Analysis, covering a wide range of topics from Complex Analysis to the computation and statistics of  zeros of Time-Frequency transforms of signals contaminated with noise.

In addition to my current role as a mathematician, I also have a keen interest in Computer Science and Quantitative Finance.
